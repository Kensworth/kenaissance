Currently building a PHP/MySQL backend to accommodate the frontend for my website and hobby projects. Toying around with bcrypt and rijndael encryption. Experimenting with AJAX/jQuery on the frontend.

In the advent of securityoverride.org being taken down, I'm highly considering turning kenaissance.com into a hacking challenge sandbox.

Work in progress.
